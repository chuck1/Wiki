- finish molten salt pin fin design
- work on heat loss validation
    - Thomas experiemental case
        - insulated receiver surface
        - hot gas at inlet
        - measured outlet temperature and insulated surface temperatures
    - I will set up simulation with inlet temperature and dirichlet temperature at insulated surface and observe outlet temperature.



Erfan may take over pressure drop simulation for 1m2 panel header.
