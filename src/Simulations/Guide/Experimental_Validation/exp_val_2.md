# Experimental Validation 2

## Goal

Simulate experimental conditions in order to separatly predict loss from insulated surfaces and from irradiated surface.

### Losses From Insulated Surfaces

Use udf to vary convective heat transfer coefficient on insulated metal surfaces in order to match experimental measurement of temperature on said surface.
